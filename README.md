# Solo Project from Chingu Voyage 10: Landing Page for *codi!* 2020

A landing page for a fictional event, designed and coded by [Melanie Althaus](https://github.com/melme12) | Voyage-10 | https://chingu.io/

Have a look at it here: https://melme12.github.io/chingu/

The design and topic were inspired by the beautiful landing page of [Within](https://gowithin.co/).

This project was created during [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) Voyage 10 (Tier 1: Design a Landing Page). For timetabling reasons I created a very basic MVP. Because my original design had more features, I will add them in this new repository.
This project included no UX Research or other methods concerning user research. It was solely to improve my coding skills. It is important to know that this project included no UX Research and only focused on improving my coding skills.

In order to gain access to the Voyage, the participants had to complete a so-called prework project. Take a look at my work here: https://github.com/melme12/chingu-v10-prework.
