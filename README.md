# Landing Page for *codi!* 2020

A landing page for a fictional event, designed and coded by [Melanie Althaus](https://github.com/melme12) | Voyage-10 | https://chingu.io/

Have a look at it here: https://melme12.github.io/chingu/

The design and topic were inspired by the beautiful landing page of [Within](https://gowithin.co/).

This project was created during [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) Voyage 10 (Tier 1: Design a Landing Page). For timetabling reasons I created a very basic MVP. Because my original design had more features, I will add them in this new repository.
